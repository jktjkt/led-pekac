Subject: [PATCH 2/3] leds: lp50xx: KConfig: fix dependencies
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

I just lost a few hours of debugging why the heck my sysfs nodes were
not created even though devm_led_classdev_multicolor_register_ext() was
returning 0. It turned out that I was missing support for the multicolor
LED device class. No errors were reported, neither during the build, nor
at runtime -- but the DTS configuration of the connected LEDs was
silently ignored.

The driver also really needs DTS -- probe fails if there are no children
in the DT, so the direct binding from userspace probably doesn't work.
That's interesting because commit
ea1ff99c9d235b8a54571d4292c71fce60993117 suggests that a direct bind was
supposed to work.
